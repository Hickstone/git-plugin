       Git plugin triggers another build when multiple new revisions are detected.
       This can lead to many unwanted builds.<br><br>
       If this option is selected, this trigger will be disabled and only one revision will get build. <br>
       This is very helpful if you are triggering the builds only by an external trigger via notifyCommit url.
